title: Exploding Kings
players: 2 - 5+<br/>
round-time: 10 - 20
---

**Objective:** Don't pick up an Exploding King

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jacks and Queens
2. Each player gets an Ace or Joker and 6 random cards
3. Count the number of players, shuffle the same number of Kings into the deck minus 1
4. Shuffle extra Aces/Jokers into the deck
5. Place the remaining (shuffled) deck face down

**Take your turn**:

- Play (and discard, using the ability) as many cards from your hand as you like until your turn is over
- End your turn by picking up a card
- If you pick up a King, you must Defuse or lose

**Defusing**:

When you pick up a King and Defuse, **you must put the King back**

You can put it face down, wherever you like, inside the deck, without inspecting the deck (and you can do this in secret).

**Hints:**

- Your cards help you avoid the Kings, play as many as you like
- Running out of cards is fine, but now you're powerless to avoid the King
- It's unlikely the King is on top of the deck, especially at the start of the game
- The game really starts when someone picks up the King and defuses as they could put it anywhere
- **When you've been Attacked, draw one card at a time**
