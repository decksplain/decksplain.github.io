**Objective:** Get rid of your cards

**Setup:**

1. Discard 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, Jokers
2. Each player gets 5 hidden cards which they can look at
3. Place remaining deck face down, start discard pile with top card face up

**Take your turn**, either:

- Discard a matching suit (e.g. 10♦ on 5♦) or matching value card (e.g. 7♣ on 7♦) with the last discarded card
  - Call Mau if you only have 1 card left
  - Call Mau Mau if your last card is a Jack
- Take a card from the draw pile

**If a player calls Mau on another player** who's on their last card, the other player must take a penalty card

**Power cards:**

| Card | Effect                                                                                                                        |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ace  | Must be played with another (matching) card. If it cannot be played with another card, a new card must be taken from the pack |
| 7    | The next player draws two cards. A 7 can be played on a 7 giving the next player 4 cards to take (and so on)                  |
| 8    | The next player skips their turn                                                                                              |
| 9    | Change the direction of play                                                                                                  |
| Jack | Wildcard, can be played on any card, the player who plays it chooses the suit of the card                                     |

**Scoring:** 7 - 10 = face value, Ace / Queen / King = 10 points, Jack = 20 points

<!--split-->

Points can be counted for each player and written down. When a player reaches a number of points (such as 100), the game ends. The player with the lowest points, wins.

- 9 is a power card
- Jack winning the round does not double everyone else's points
