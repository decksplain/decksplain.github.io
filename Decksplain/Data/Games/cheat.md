**Objective:** Get rid of your cards

**Setup:**

1. Discard jokers, combine decks if playing with more players
2. Deal cards out to all players which they can look at
    - Some players may end up with an extra card
3. The player to the left of the dealer starts with aces

**Take your turn**:

- Declare the number of cards you're discarding and the rank (e.g. 2 aces)
  - You may only follow the previous rank (e.g. 2 has to be played after ace)
- Discard, face down, the same number of cards you declared
  - Note that the cards you discard may not match the cards you declared

**Calling cheat**:

1. If you think a player has cheated, you can challenge that player by saying "Cheat"
2. The played cards are revealed
    1. If the player cheated, they take all the discarded cards, you then start the next play
    2. If the player did not lie, you take all the discarded cards, and play continues clockwise

**Other notes**:

- Aces follow kings
- The game is played clockwise
