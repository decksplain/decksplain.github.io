title: Exploding Kittens
players: 2 - 5+
round-time: 10 - 20

**Objective:** Don't pick up an Exploding Kitten

**Setup:**

1. Each player gets a Defuse card
2. Count the number of players, shuffle the same number of Exploding Kittens into the deck minus 1
3. Shuffle extra Defuses into the deck
4. Place the remaining (shuffled) deck face down

**Take your turn**:

- Play (and discard, using the ability) as many cards from your hand as you like until your turn is over
- End your turn by picking up a card
- If you pick up an Exploding Kitten, you must Defuse or lose

**Defusing**:

When you pick up an Exploding Kitten and Defuse, **you must put the bomb back**

You can put it face down, wherever you like, inside the deck, without inspecting the deck (and you can do this in secret).

**Hints:**

- Your cards help you avoid the Exploding Kittens, play as many as you like
- Running out of cards is fine, but now you're powerless to avoid the Exploding Kitten
- It's unlikely the Exploding Kitten is on top of the deck, especially at the start of the game
- The game really starts when someone picks up the bomb and defuses as they could put it anywhere
- **When you've been Attacked, draw one card at a time**
