title: Cabo
players: 2 - 4
round-time: 5
description: A strategic memory card game where players try to end with the lowest score by remembering and swapping cards, with special powers that can peek at or exchange cards.
---

**Objective:** End the game with the **lowest score**

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jokers
2. Each player gets 4 face-down cards in a grid; peek at 2
3. Place remaining deck face down, start discard pile with top card face up

**Take your turn**, either:

- Draw from the deck and peak at the card:
  - If it’s a power card, you can use it (discard after)
  - Or exchange (see below)
- Draw the top card from the discard pile and exchange (see below)
- Call Cabo to end the game after others get one more turn

**Exchanging cards,** either:

- exchange the new card for one of your face down cards
- exchange the new card with matching multiples of your face down cards

A failed matching requires picking up a penalty card.

**Power cards:**

| Card          | Power | Effect                                       |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 7 - 8         | Peek  | Look at one of your own cards                |
| 9 - 10        | Spy   | Look at one opponent’s card                  |
| Jack or Queen | Swap  | Swap one of your cards with another player’s |

**Scoring:** Lowest points = 0 points, Calling Cabo and losing = card points + 5 points, Ace = 1, 2 - 10 = face value, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, Black King = 13, Red King = 0

<!--split-->

After the round ends, score up everyone's remaining cards and keep track of the total points everyone has accumulated. When a player gets to 100 points, the game ends.
