**Objective:** End the game with the **lowest score**

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jokers
2. Each player gets 4 face-down cards in a grid; peek at 2
3. Place remaining deck face down, start discard pile with top card face up

**Take your turn**, either:

- Draw from deck and peak at the card:
  - If it’s a power card, you can use it (discard after)
  - Or exchange with a card from your face down cards
- Draw the top card from the discard pile and exchange with a card from your face down cards
- Call Cabo to end the game after others get one more turn

**Discarding cards:** When a card is discarded, you can match a face down card from anyone’s pile to discard it too

- If from your own pile → fewer cards = fewer points
- If from another's pile → give them one of your cards
- Wrong match = take a penalty card

**Power cards:**

| Card          | Power | Effect                                       |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 7 - 8         | Peek  | Look at one of your own cards                |
| 9 - 10        | Spy   | Look at one opponent’s card                  |
| Jack or Queen | Swap  | Swap one of your cards with another player’s |

**Scoring:** Calling Cabo and winning = 0 points (total!), Calling Cabo and losing = card points + 5 points, Ace = 1, 2 - 10 = face value, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13, Red King = 0

<!--split-->

After the round ends, score up everyone's remaining cards and keep track of the total points everyone has accumulated. When a player gets to 100 points, the game ends.

<!--
Notable changes:
- The original game has different cards for red and black kings so they could not be matched

House rules:
- Only calling Cabo can earn you 0 points, not having the lowest points
- You can match opponents cards - this makes it into a potentially aggresive game of snap
- Matching a card can be done out of turn
