**Objective:** End the game with the **lowest score**

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jokers
2. Each player get 4 face down cards, place them in a grid, peek at two of them
3. Remaining cards are placed face down, take the top card and place it face up in the discard pile

**Take your turn**, either:

- Draw from the face down pile and peak at it
  - If it’s a power card, you can use it (discard after)
  - Or exchange with a card from your face down cards
- Draw the top card from the discard pile and exchange with a card from yoru face down cards
- Call Cabo if you think you can win, everyone else will get one more turn

**Discarding cards:** When a card is discarded, you can match a face down card from anyone’s pile to discard it too

- Discarding a card from yours will mean you have one less card, so less points!
- If you discard a card from someone else’s cards, you can then give them one of your cards
- If you reveal a card which does not match, you must take a penalty card

**Power cards:**

| Card          | Power | Effect                                       |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 7 - 8         | Peek  | Look at one of your own cards                |
| 9 - 10        | Spy   | Look at one opponent’s card                  |
| Jack or Queen | Swap  | Swap one of your cards with another player’s |

**Scoring:** Calling Cabo and winning = -3 points (total!), Calling Cabo and losing = card points + 10 points, Ace = 1, 2 - 10 = face value, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13, Red King = 0
