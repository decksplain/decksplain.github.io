**Objective:** End the game with the **lowest score**

**Setup:**

- Each player get 4 face down cards, peek at two of them
- Remaining cards are placed face down, take the top card and place it face up in the discard pile

**Take your turn**, either:

- Draw from the face down pile
  - If it’s a power card, you can use it (discard after)
  - Or replace a card from your face down cards
- Pick a card from the discard pile and place one of your own cards on the discard pile
- Call Cabo if you think you can win, everyone else will get one more turn

**Discarding cards:** When a card is discarded, you can match a face down card from anyone’s pile to discard it too

- Discarding a card from yours will mean you have one less card, so less points!
- If you discard a card from someone else’s cards, you can then give them one of your cards
- If you reveal a card which does not match, you must take a penalty card
