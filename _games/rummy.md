**Objective:** Be the first player to use all your cards and have the lowest points left in your hand

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jokers
2. Each player gets 7 cards
3. Remaining cards are placed face down

**Take your turn**, either:

- Draw one card from either the stock pile
- Use a card from your hand to add to a set or run on the table

**Using cards:**

- A set is 3 or more cards of the same rank (e.g., 7♣ 7♦ 7♠)
- A run is 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4♦ 5♦ 6♦)
- You can add cards to your own or other players sets/runs once you’ve laid down at least one set or run

**Ending the round:**

- The round ends when a player discards their last card
- Other players then count the points in their remaining hands

**Scoring:** Ace = 1, 2 - 10 = face value, Face cards = 10
