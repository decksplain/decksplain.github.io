**Objective:** Don't pickup an Exploding King

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jacks and Queens
2. Each player gets an Ace or Joker and 6 random cards
3. Shuffle Kings and extra Aces/Jokers into the deck
4. Place the remaining (shuffled) deck face down

**Take your turn**:

- End your turn by picking up a card
- If you pickup a King, you must Defuse or lose

**Cards:**

| Card        | Power          | Effect                                                                                                          |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ace / Joker | Defuse         | Ace (or Joker) is an extra life! Defuse the King and place the King back where ever you like in the deck        |
| 1 - 4       | None           | Useless unless used in identical pairs/trios or in a distinct quintet                                           |
| 5           | Favour         | Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give you                   |
| 6           | Skip           | End (only!) one of your turns                                                                                   |
| 7           | Shuffle        | Feeling lucky? Shuffle the deck                                                                                 |
| 8           | See the future | The magic 8 ball allows you to view the top 3 cards from the deck                                               |
| 9           | Nope           | Nein! Cancel the last played action (before it happens!). Can be played by anyone anytime. Cannot Nope a Defuse |
| 10          | Attack         | 10 in binary = 2 decimal - move play onto the next player, they get your # of turns + 2                         |
