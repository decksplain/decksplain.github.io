title: Exploding Kings
players: 2 - 5
round-time: 10 minutes

**Objective:** Don't pickup an Exploding King

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jacks and Queens
2. Each player gets an Ace or Joker and 6 random cards
3. Count the number of players, shuffle the same number of Kings into the deck minus 1
3. Shuffle extra Aces/Jokers into the deck
4. Place the remaining (shuffled) deck face down

**Take your turn**:

- Play (and discard) as many cards from your hand as you like until your turn is over
- End your turn by picking up a card
- If you pickup a King, you must Defuse or lose

**Hints:**

- Your cards help you avoid the Kings, play as many as you like
- Running out of cards is fine, but now you're powerless to avoid the King
- It's unlikely the King is on top of the deck, especially at the start of the game
