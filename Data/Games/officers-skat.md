Basic rules for a suit game

**Objective:** Win each round with the best card, end the game with the **highest score**

**Vocabulary:**

- trump cards are the highest valued

**Setup:**

1. Discard 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, Jokers
2. Each player gets 1 row of 4 cards face down
3. One player then gets 4 face up cards on top of their face down cards and chooses a suit to be trumps
4. 4 more face up cards are placed on the remaining face down row
5. 2 more rows are added to each player in the same way

**Play:**

1. The player who chose trumps (or won the last play) plays a card
2. The second player then plays a card in return - they must play in the same suit if possible
3. The best played card wins
4. Exposed face down cards are flipped
5. Play again until all cards are used

**The winning card:**

The order from high to low is:

1. Jacks in order: ♣ Clubs, ♠ Spades, ♥  Hearts, ♦ Diamonds
2. Trumps suit in order: A-10-K-Q-9-8-7
3. First played card suit: A-10-K-Q-9-8-7
4. Any other card loses
