title: Cabo Rush
players: 2 - 4+
round-time: 5 minutes
---

**Objective:** End the game with the **lowest score**

**Setup:**

1. Discard Jokers
2. Each player gets 4 face-down cards in a grid; peek at the 2 closest cards
3. Place remaining deck face down, start discard pile with top card face up

**Take your turn**, either:

- Draw from deck and peak at the card:
  - If it’s a power card, you can use it (discard after)
  - Or exchange with a card from your face down cards
- Draw the top card from the discard pile and exchange with a card from your face down cards
- Call Cabo to end the game after others get one more turn

**Discarding cards:** When a card is discarded, you can match a face down card from anyone’s pile to discard it too

- When attempting a match, reveal the card to everyone
- If from your own pile → fewer cards = fewer points
- If from another's pile → give them one of your cards
- Wrong match = take a penalty card (no peeking)

**Power cards:**

| Card                   | Power                 | Effect                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 7 - 8                  | Peek                  | Look at one of your own cards                |
| 9 - 10                 | Spy                   | Look at one opponent’s card                  |
| Jack&nbsp;/&nbsp;Queen | Swap                  | Swap one of your cards with another player’s |
| Black King             | Peek&nbsp;+&nbsp;Swap | Peek and then optionally swap                |

**Scoring:** Calling Cabo and winning = -3 points (total!), Calling Cabo and losing = card points + 5 points, Ace = 1, 2 - 10 = face value, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, Black King = 13, Red King = 0

**After the round ends**:

- Score up everyone's remaining cards and keep track of the total points everyone has accumulated
- When a player reaches 100 points, the game ends

**Further rules:**

- Players can communicate as they like, but cards shouldn't be intentionally revealed
- When a player has no cards, the game ends instantly
- If a player peeks a card when they shouldn't, they get a penalty card
- When the draw pile gets low, the discarded cards are shuffled back in
- Only calling Cabo and having the lowest points is considered winning the round
